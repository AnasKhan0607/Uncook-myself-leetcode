## üìö Repository Structure

This repository is organized by problem categories to help track progress and find solutions easily.

### Categories

- **[Arrays](./Arrays/)** - Array manipulation, traversal, and algorithms
- **[Strings](./Strings/)** - String manipulation and pattern matching
- **[Linked-Lists](./Linked-Lists/)** - Singly and doubly linked list problems
- **[Trees](./Trees/)** - Binary trees, BST, and tree algorithms
- **[Graphs](./Graphs/)** - Graph traversal, shortest paths, and graph algorithms
- **[Dynamic-Programming](./Dynamic-Programming/)** - DP problems and optimization
- **[Binary-Search](./Binary-Search/)** - Binary search and variants
- **[Sorting](./Sorting/)** - Sorting algorithms and related problems
- **[Hashing](./Hashing/)** - Hash tables, maps, and sets
- **[Stack-Queue](./Stack-Queue/)** - Stack and queue data structures
- **[Backtracking](./Backtracking/)** - Backtracking and recursive solutions
- **[Greedy](./Greedy/)** - Greedy algorithms
- **[Math](./Math/)** - Mathematical algorithms and number theory
- **[Bit-Manipulation](./Bit-Manipulation/)** - Bitwise operations
- **[Two-Pointers](./Two-Pointers/)** - Two pointer technique
- **[Sliding-Window](./Sliding-Window/)** - Sliding window problems

## üìù How to Use

1. **Adding a New Solution**:
   - Navigate to the appropriate category folder
   - Create a new file with the problem name (e.g., `two-sum.py`, `reverse-linked-list.java`)
   - Include problem number and description in comments at the top of the file

2. **File Naming Convention**:
   - Use lowercase with hyphens: `problem-name.ext`
   - Include LeetCode number if desired: `001-two-sum.py`

3. **Solution Template**:
   ```
   # LeetCode #[Number]: [Problem Name]
   # Difficulty: [Easy/Medium/Hard]
   # Link: [LeetCode URL]
   #
   # Problem Description:
   # [Brief description]
   #
   # Solution Approach:
   # [Your approach]
   
   [Your code here]
   ```
